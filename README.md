The Data

People are around me and including myself are dramatically increased the amount of time on online grocery than in-store grocery in 2020 when pandemic just came. The pandemic made it increasingly common for shoppers to reach for their phones or laptops when they need groceries, or anything else rather than heading to the supermarket or other physical stores. 

In this project, I will use online grocery order dataset try to understand the buying behaviour. I am using PostgreSQL to uncover these objectives:

1.	What day within a week is the busiest online shopping day by the total number of orders?

2.	What are peak shopping hours?

3.	Which department has the greatest number of orders?

4.	Which product has the greatest number of orders?

5.	The average number of days from previous to next purchases.

6.	The total number of orders with alcohol
